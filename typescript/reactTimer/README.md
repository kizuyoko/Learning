## Why TypeScript?
TypeScript builds up on JavaScript and **extends** its syntax by adding **strong typing**.

- TypeScript allows for annotations.
- The assigned types are then enforced by TypeScript.

TypeScript helps you **catch & fix** type-related **errors earlier**.
Sometimes, that comes at the expense of having to define **complex value types**.
